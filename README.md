banditology
===========

A study of various n-armed bandit algorithms.  Based on Sutton and
Barto, Reinforcement Learning, An Introduction.

We compare various algorithms to solve the n-armed bandit problem.

In industry, we write code to make cool projects to sell to people.
In academia, we write code to make cool graphs. If you want to look
at the graphs without running this code yourself (it does take some
time!), take a look at html/main.html.
