banditology
===========

A study of various n-armed bandit algorithms. 
Based on Sutton and Barto, Reinforcement Learning, An Introduction.

We compare various algorithms to solve the n-armed bandit problem.

This project is literate MATLAB. The main file main.m is fully documented
and is used to generate published code (including pretty graphs).
